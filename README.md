# About

This project is a take home challenge for my interview process with Somos in January 2024.

The project is a book finder that loads in a finite set of data about books from a file in the back end and allows searching and favoriting.

# Setup

1. Ensure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed.
2. Ensure [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is installed.
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/grantreighard/somos-books.git`
4. Change into the frontend directory `cd frontend/`
5. Install the modules `yarn install`
6. In a new terminal, change into the backend directory `cd backend/`
7. Install the modules `yarn install`
8. In backend terminal, run the server `yarn start` or `yarn dev`
9. In the frontend terminal, run the webapp `yarn start`
10. Visit the [webapp](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

# Notes

- No .env files are required. There are no external environment variables for either the front end or back end.
